## About me:
I got acquainted with the development of websites at the university in the 3rd year.

After a few months, he started working on a freelance exchange together with a mentor.

After working for more than a year, I moved to another exchange, where I worked together with the manager for about 3 and a half years.
All this time I have been developing websites on WordPress, sometimes from scratch, sometimes I also edited from templates.

Currently, I work as a medical engineer. In parallel, I sometimes take orders from old clients.

Now I want to go deeper into "real programming" and become a Front End developer
